# ShortestPath

### Aakash Madabhushi and Michael Neely

- We have Implemented dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path between cities in Illinois using a custom data text file. This includes inputting the start city, end city and the list of cities to avoid.

By choosing a city to avoid, we modify the graph by removing the city(including its edges) and run Dijkstra's Algorithm.
